ABSTRACT
 
 
 
The COVID
-
19 pandemic is creating a 
crucial outbrea
k all around the world, 
having a severe impact on the lives of 
people globally. One of the majo
r steps 
in fighting COVID
-
19 is detecting the 
infected patients as early as possible and 
providing them with special care. 
Furthermore
, in countries that are not
 
able to afford laboratory kits for testing, 
using chest x
-
ray images
 
 
becomes even 
more conven
ient.
 
Some of the previous 
works showed specific abnormalities in 
the chest radiograms of the patients 
infected with COVID
-
19, which 
inspired the detecting of th
e virus 
through chest X
-
ray. In this paper we 
prepare
 
 
our own dataset by combining 
the positiv
e and negative images that we 
garnered through two different sources 
from available datasets. In the dataset we 
have the chest X
-
ray images of patients 
having co
vid19 and the other images are 
of healthy people. We then trained our 
model and tuned a convolu
tional neural 
network to diagnose covid19 using 
keras, tensorflow and deep learning. 
Additionally we used opencv for loading 
and processing the images on the 
dat
aset.
 
 
Further the model has been successfully 
deployed using the flask api. It helped us 
to de
velop screening technology for the 
covid19 virus, a crucial worldwide 
challenge identified by the WHO[1] In 
that we showed results of the patients 
that had negat
ive or positive chest x ray.
 
 
 
1 INTRODUCTION
 
 
Since December 2019, a new disease 
spread by a v
irus of the corona family 
has put the whole world under a threat. 
It is reported that people with low 
immunity, old age and with previous 
medical history especia
lly related to 
lungs are more likely to get infected with 
the COVID
-
19 virus.It is specified as
 
a 
universal welfare emergency of its time 
and it has escalated all over the world. 
Due to its communicable effect, 
governments of various nations are 
forcing fr
inge limitations, travel 
limitations, social distancing, and 
spreading consciousness of cleanli
ness. 
However, the virus is still spreading 
swiftly. The majority of the people 

experienced gentle to direct respiratory 
illness, whil
e some built up devastating 
pneumonia. Certain assumptions are 
being made that elderly people w
ith 
basic clinical problems like 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 
ceaseless respiratory infection and 
malignant growth are bound to produce 
actual disease [2]. 
Until now, there is no 

19. Since this disease is highly 
co
ntagious the early the patients are 
diagnosed the better it is. Early diagnosis 
of the disease not only helps contain the 
virus, it also helps in fast recovery. 
It 
will also help in taking the pressure off 
the healthcare system and until a cure is 
found fo
r the virus, detecting it early will 
reduce the damage to the world economy 
as well.
 
 
In some of the research it was discovered 
that through radiography [3] and 
CT, the 
patient having covid19 was one of the 
possibilities. The presence of bilateral 
nodular 
and peripheral ground glass 
opacities should serve as an alert to 
radiologists [4] that COVID19 may 
actually be present in certain patients. In 
addition to that,
 
performing a CT scan 
has a lesser risk of spreading the bacteria 
unlike the tests that involve
 
examining 
the patients respiratory system. With the 
advances in computer science and 
artificial intelligence/ machine learning 
automatic
 
 
methods which can help
 
identify the virus at an early stage with 
high accuracy can help the diagnosis 
process.
 
Variou
s machine learning approaches 
have been used to classify digitised chest 
images, similarly CNN architecture is 
one of the most popular deep learning 
approaches w
ith superior achievements 
in the medical imaging domain. The 
foremost achievement of CNN is due
 
to 
its ability to learn features automatically 
from the domain specific images. The 
plan of action for training CNN is to 
transfer the grasped knowledge from a 
pre
-
trained network that attained one 
task into a new task. In this paper, we use 
a machine lea
rning framework to predict 
whether the chest X
-
ray images are of a 
COVID19 patient or not.
 
We prepared the dataset of chest xray 
images of the patients
 
 
diagnose
d with 
covid19 and
 
 
a set of images of patients 
who were diagnosed with pneumonia[5] 
that forgo
 
the presence of covid19. The 
model was trained with convolutional 
neural network to diagnose the chest 
xray images and predict the patients 
having covid19.

ELATED WORK
 
 
This part oversees a survey on the recent 
scientific researches for applying deep 
learning in the field of medicine
 
 
and 
coronavirus X
-
ray classification. An 
object detection based DarkCovidNet 
model has been proposed by Ozturk et 
al. [6] for 
automatic det
ection of 
COVID
-
19 cases from the Xray images. 
They have reported accuracy of 98.08 % 
for binary classification of X
-
ray images 
into COVID
-
19.
 
Similarly, Narin et al. [7] have applied 
ResNet50, InceptionV3 and 
InceptionResNetV2 using transfer 
learning for classification of the X
-
ray 
images into normal and COVID
-
19 
class. This method achieved good 
performance with an accuracy of 96 % 
with ResNet50
. However, the number of 
X
-
ray images are only 100 and the 
number of images was very less.

3 CNN
 
 
Model
 
 
Convolutional Neural Networks are a 
category of deep learning techniques 
used mainly
 
 
to recognize and classify 
the image. Convolutional Neural 
Net
works have achieved astounding 
success for medical image or video 
classification and detection. 
A ty
pical 
CNN structure has a convolution layer 
that extracts features from the input with 
the filters it applies, a pooling layer to 
decrease the size for comp
utational 
performance, and an entirely connected 
layer, which is a neural network.[9] By 
merging suc
h layers, a CNN model is 
created, and its parameters are modified 
to attain a particular task, such as 
classification or object recognition.
 
The
 
 
model that
 
we trained
 
 
ends with 
Avgpool and Softmax layers that 
produce the outputs. Eventually, a deep 
model
 
with a huge number of layers is 
required for the feature extraction of a 
real
-
time object detection system[10].
 
The proposed model consists of 
convolutiona
l layers followed by ReLU 
operations, [11]
 
while each 3 × Conv 
layer has the same setup three times 
in 
successive form, the Maxpool method is 
used in all the pooling operations. 
Maxpool reduces
 
 
an input by taking the 
maximum of a region determined by its 
filter. While operating with two classes, 
the proposed model performs the 
COVID
-
19 detection task[12
-
15
].

parameters of the model are given below

ATASET
 
 
For this paper, we have combined two 
sets of dataset from different sources 
togethe
r[1
6
-
19
]. From one set we have 
obtained the positive images that are 
the images of chest X
-
rays of patients 
that are infected with covid19 and 
from the other set we have obtain
ed 
the negative images that are the chest 
X
-
rays of patients that are not infected 
with covid19 virus. For the positive 
images we have parsed the 
metadata.csv file found in the covid 
chest xray dataset from github[
20
-
2
4]. 
This open dataset accommodates chest 
X
-
ray and CT images of patients that 
are infected or suspected of covid19 or 
other 
viral infections such as MERS, 
SARS, and ARDS. The image count for 
covid19 infected people was
 
approximately
 
1300
 
and the rest of the 
images were of other diseases 
including the bacterial 
infections and 
the unknown. For the negative images 
we used the chest xray image 
pn
eumonia dataset from kaggle, thi
s
 
dataset is organized into 
2
 
folders 
(train, test
) and contains subfolders for 
each image category 
(Pneumonia/Normal). There are 
approximately 
1500
 
X
-
Ray images and 
2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).
 
It 
also carries some meta

The chest 
X
-
rays of people having either 
covid
19
 
or other disease showed a 
number of signs which distinguished 
them from
 
the chest X
-
ray of a healthy 
person. The most common and obvious 
signs were consolidation with
 
air 
bronchograms predominantly 
on the 
right side which means presence of fluid 
and/or tissue in pulmonary alveoli 
preventing gas exchange, nodular 
shadowing
 
pri
marily
 
affecting 
peripheral and lower areas of the lungs. 
The scans also showed signs 
of
 
 
obscured rig
ht diaphragmatic 
silhouette and presence of ground glass 
opacity. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 RES
ULT
 
 
We carried out experiments to detect and 
classify COVID
-
19 using X
-
ray i
mages 
from two different datasets. The 
performance of the proposed model is 
evaluated using the cross
-
validation 
method for the classification problem. 
80% of X
-
ray images are used for
 
training and 20% for validation. We 
used 1500 images for the training a
nd 
2000 images for validation.
 
 
It can be 
noted
 
 
that our proposed model has 
achieved an average accuracy of 98.9 % 
in detecting COVID
-
19.
 
 
 
Henceforth
, we aim to validate our 
model by 
including more images. This 
developed model can be set in a cloud to 
pro
vide diagnosis instantly and to help 
reinstate affected patients immediately. 
This should lessen the workload of 
health workers to an extent . We will 
collect CT images for COVID
-
19 
de
tection and compare the
 
 
results with 
the proposed model trained using X
-
ray 
images. Also, we will try to gather local 
radiology images for COVID
-
19 cases 
and evaluate them with our model from 
sites. Further we deployed the model 
using python backend with 
a flask web 
development framework to screen the 
results.

CONCLUSION
 
 
The 2019
 
 
Coronavirus is a family of 
viruses that leads to illnesses ranging 
from the common cold to more severe 
diseases and may 
lead to death according 
to World Health Organization, with the 
advances in computer algorithms and 
especially artificial intel
ligence, the 
detection of this type of virus in early 
stages will help in fast recovery. In this 
paper, a CNN approach with deep 
l
earning for COVID
-
19 detection 
in
 
 
chest X
-
ray images is presented. The 
primary purpose is to verify the X
-
ray 
images and use 
CNN to detect the virus 
from the images.
 
We have put forward a 
deep learning based model to detect and 
classify COVID
-
19 cases fro
m X
-
ray 
images. Our model is completely 
automated with an end
-
to
-
end structure 
without the need for manual feature 
extraction.
